Just a personnal project using react to practice and experiment after finishing [Epic React](https://epicreact.dev) courses.
It uses my repo scheduler_restAPI as a rest api (built with express).

Features added (fully or partially) in the app:
 - authentication
 - add team(s), teammate(s)
 - create/update/delete planning and save them
 - some testing with jest & [testing-library](https://testing-library.com/)

Maybe i will reuse it in the future as a training/experiment playground.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
